# WeatherForecast

This is a simple app that will pull weather from the OpenWeatherMap api (http://openweathermap.org/) in order to display the current temperature and wind speed for 5 European cities. Clicking on each city will reveal a forecast for temperatures in the next 12 hours.


## Development

This app was made using Angular 2 and Angular CLI. To run this locally, first run `npm install` to pull down all of the necessary external dependancies, and then run `ng serve` to start the server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.


## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). However, there are are no real tests for the app at this time.
